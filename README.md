This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The bug arises from an off-by-one error in a for loop that iterates over an array.  The solution demonstrates the correct way to iterate over an array to avoid this common error.  The example is designed to highlight the importance of carefully checking loop conditions when working with arrays in Java.
